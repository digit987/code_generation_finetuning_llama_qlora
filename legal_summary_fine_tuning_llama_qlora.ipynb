Maheshwari, for the respondent.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by Grover, J.\\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Rajasthan High Court holding that the appellant was not entitled to file an appeal against the order of the Company Judge directing sale of lease hold rights of the Golcha Properties (P) Ltd. (in liquidation) in the land belonging to the appellant.\\nThe facts briefly are that on November 5, 1960 an agreement was entered into between the appellant and the respondent company allowing Golcha Properties (P) Ltd. to construct a cinema threatre within three years from the issue of the 'No Objection Certificate ' on land measuring 42,900 sq.\\nfeet at Bhagwandas Road, Jaipur belonging to the appellant.\\nThe Company deposited a sum of Rs. 5 lakhs by way of security.\\nIn October 1963 No Objection Certificate is stated to have been issued for construction of a cinema theatre.\\nIn 1966 a petition for winding up of the company was filed in the Rajasthan High Court.\\nOn May 10, 1968 an order for winding up of the company was made and a liquidator was appointed ' On July 11, 1969 the Official Liquidator made a report to the Company Judge for sale of the lease hold rights of the company in the land belonging to the appellant and the structures standing on it.\\nIt appears that the Official, Liquidator made a report under section 457 of the Indian to obtain the necessary orders for sale.\\nOn July 21, 1969 the Company Judge without hearing any one or issuing notice to the appellant ordered that the lease hold rights and the structures be auctioned as proposed by the Official Liquidator On October 3,1969 the appellant 's attorney sent a letter to the Official Liquidator stating that the licence granted to the company under, an.\\nagreement dated November 5, 1960 stood revoked and called upon him to deliver possession of the land and also pay compensation amounting to Rs. 10, lakhs.\\nOn February 9, 1970 the Official Liquidator sent a reply claiming that the company was entitled to a lease for 20 years under the agreement.\\nOn March 14, 1970 a notice was issued in a newspaper (Times of India) in respect of the proposed auction sale ,of lease hold rights which was to take place on April 14, 1970.\\n249 According to the appellant she enquired from the Official Liquidator under whose authority the, property was being sold to which no reply was sent by the Official Liquidator.\\nOn April 3, 1970 the appellant applied for a certified copy of the order dated July 21,1969 after taking inspection of the record in the High Court.\\nThe certified copy was sent on April 24, 1970.\\nOn the same date the appellant filed an appeal before the High Court.\\nThe High Court rejected that application summarily but recorded short order.\\nIn the order of the High Court reference has been made to Rule 139 of the Companies (Court) Rules 1959 and it has been pointed out that since the appellant had not appeared before the Company Judge she was not entitled to maintain the appeal.\\nIt was conceded that no notice had ever been sent to her either by the Official Liquidator or the Company Judge before the order appealed against relating to appellant 's property was made.\\nThe High Court was of the view that the only remedy of the appellant was by way of a suit after obtaining leave of the Company Judge under section 446 of the Act.\\nNow an appeal lies under section 483 of the Act from any order made or decision given in the matter of finding up of a company by the court and it lies to the same court to which, in the same manner in which, and subject to the same conditions under which, appeals lie from any order or deci sion of the Court in cases within its ordinary jurisdiction.\\nThere can be no manner of doubt that an appeal was competent against the order made by the Company Judge on July 21, 1969 in view of the terms of section 483.\\nThe only question is whether because the Official Liquidator failed to discharge his duties properly by having a notice issued to the appellant, whose rights were directly affected by the order proposed to be made, the appellant was debarred from filing the appeal.\\nIn our opinion apart from Rule 139 to which reference has been made by the High Court the Official Liquidator as well as the learned Company Judge were bound by the rules of natural justice to issue a notice to the appellant and hear her before making the order appealed against.\\nIf there was default on their part in not following the correct procedure it is wholly incomprehensible how the appellant could be deprived of her right to get her grievance redressed by filing an appeal against the order which had been made in her absence and without her knowledge.\\nIt would be a travesty of justice if a party is driven to file a suit which would involve long and cumbersome procedure when an order has been made directly affecting that party and redress can be had by filing an appeal which is permitted by law.\\nIt is well settled that a person who is not a party to the suit may prefer an appeal with the leave of the appellate court and such leave should be granted if he would be prejudicially affected by the judgment.\\n250 Rule 103 of the Companies (Court) Rules provide for taking out summons for directions not only with reference to the settlement of the list of contributories and the list of creditors but also the axercise by the Official Liquidator of all or any of the powers under section 457(1) and any other matter requiting directions of the court.\\nThe exercise of the power under section 457 (1) (c) of the Act to sell the immovable and movable property of the Company by public auction or private contract would certainly fall Within the ambit of the Rule.\\nThat Rule expressly provides for issuing of a notice of the summons to the petitioner on whose petition the order for winding up was made.\\nIt is implicit that if the directions which have to be given by the court would affect any person prejudicially he: must be served with a notice of the summons under the general rule of natural justice and that no order should be made affecting the rights of a party without affording a proper opportunity to it to represent its case.\\nThe High Court was thus clearly in error in not entertaining and deciding the appeal preferred by the appellant who was the owner of the land in which lease hold rights said to have been created by her in favour of the Company in liquidation were sought to be sold.\\nThe appeal is allowed and the order of the High Court is set aside.\\nThe case is remanded to the High Court for disposing of the appeal in accordance with law.\\nCosts shall abide the event.\\nY.P. Appeal allowed.\\n [/INST] The respondent company holding leasehold rights in the appellant land went into liquidation.\\nAccepting the.\\nofficial liquidator 's report the company Judge (Rajasthan High Court) without hearing anyone or issuing notice to the appellant ordered auction of the lease hold right of the respondent company.\\nThe appellant sent a letter to the Official Liquidator revoking the licence granted to the company and calling upon him to, deliver possession of the land.\\nThe Official Liquidator claimed that the company was entitled to a further period of lease under the agreement.\\nNotice was issued in respect of the proposed auction sale.\\nThe appellant filed an appeal before the High Court.\\nThe High Court held that since the appellant had not appeared before the company Judge, she was not entitled to maintain the appeal, and further that the only remedy of the appellant was by way of a suit after obtaining leave of the Company Judge under section 446 of the Indian Companies Act.\\nIn appeal to this Court, HELD : The High Court was in error in not entertaining and deciding the appeal preferred by the appellant who was the owner of the land in which lease hold rights said to have been created by her in favour of the company in liquidation were sought to be sold.\\nAn appeal lies under section 483 of the Act from any order made or decision given in the matter of winding up of a company by the Court and it lies to the same, court to which, in the same manner in which, and subject to the same conditions under which appeals lie from any order or decision of the Court in cases within its ordinary jurisdiction.\\nTherefore an appeal was corn tent against the order of the company Judge.\\n[249 D] It is implicit in Rule 103 of the Company Court Rules that if the directions which have to be given by the Court would affect any person prejudicially he must be served with a notice of the summons under the general rule of natural justice and that no order should be made affecting the rights of a party without affording a proper opportunity to it to represent its case.\\nA] Further, the Official Liquidator as well as the, learned company Judge were bound by the rules of natural justice to issue a notice to the appellant and hear her before making the order appealed against.\\nIf there was default on their part in not following the correct procedure the appellant could not be deprived of her right to get her grievance redressed by filing an appeal.\\n[250 C] 248\\n </s>\",\n  '<s> [INST]ition (Criminal) No.1451 of 1985 Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India.\\nPetitioner in person.\\nHarbans Lal.\\nTapas Ray, D.K.

Khanwilkar for the Respondents.\\nThe order of the Court was delivered by MISRA J.\\nWe made an Order on 12th July, 1986 issuing various directions in regard to physically and mentally retarded children as also abandoned or destitute children who are lodged in various jails in the country for \\'safe custody \\'.\\nWe also directed the Director General of Doordarshan as also the Director General of All India Radio to give publicity seeking cooperation of non governmental social service organisations in the task of rehabilitation of these children.\\nWe were extremely pained and anguished that these children should be kept in jail instead of being properly looked after, given adequate medical treatment and imparted training in various skills which would make them independent and self reliant.\\nSome years ago we came out with a National Policy for the Welfare of Children which contained the following preambulatory declaration: \"The nation \\'s children are a supremely important asset.\\nTheir nurture and solicitude are our responsibility.\\nChildren \\'s programme should find a prominent part in our national plans for the development of human resources, so that our children grow up to become robust citizens, physi cally fit, mentally alert and morally healthy, endowed with the skill and motivations needed by society.\\nEqual opportunities for development to all children during the period of growth should be our aim, for this would serve our large purpose of reducing inequality and ensuring social justice.\\n\" If a child is a national asset, it is the duty of the State to look after the child with a view to ensuring full development of its personality.\\nThat 565 is why all the statutes dealing with children provide that child shall not be kept in jail.\\nEven apart from this statutory prescription, it is elementary that a jail is hardly a place where a child should be kept.\\nThere can be no doubt that incarceration in jail would have the effect of dwarfing the development of the child, exposing him to baneful influences, coarsening his conscience and alienating him from the society.\\nIt is a matter of regret that despite statutory provisions and frequent exhortations by social scientists, there are still a large number of children in different jails in the country as is now evident from the reports of the survey made by the District Judges pursuant to our order dated 15th April, 1986.\\nEven where children are accused of offences, they must not be kept in jails.\\nIt is no answer on the part of the State to say that it has not got enough number of remand homes or observation homes or other places where children can be kept and that is why they are lodged in jails.\\nIt is also no answer on the part of the State to urge that the ward in the jail where the children are kept in separate from the ward in which the other prisoners are detained.\\nIt is the atmosphere of the jail which has a highly injurious effect on the mind of the child, estranging him from the society and breeding in him aversion bordering on hatred against a system which keeps him in jail.\\nWe would therefore like once again to impress upon the State Governments that they must set up necessary remand homes and observation homes where children accused of an offence can be lodged pending investigation and trial.\\nOn no account should the children be kept in jail and if a State Government has not got sufficient accommodation in the remand homes or observation homes, the children should be released on bail instead of being subjected to incarceration in jail.\\nThe problem of detention of children accused of an offence would become much more easy of solution if the investigation in the police and the trial by the Magistrate could be expedited.\\nThe reports of survey made by District Judges show that in some places children have been in jail for quite long periods.\\nWe fail to see why investigation into offences alleged to have been committed by children cannot be completed quickly and equally why can the trial not take place within a reasonable time after the filing of the charge sheet.\\nReally speaking, the trial of children must take place in the Juvenile Courts and not in the regular criminal courts.\\nThere are special provisions enacted in various statutes relating to children providing for trial by Juvenile Courts in accordance with a special procedure intended to safeguard the interest and welfare of children, but, we find that in many of the States there are no Juvenile Courts functioning at all and 566 even where there are Juvenile Courts, they are nothing but a replica of the ordinary criminal courts, only the label being changed.\\nThe same Magistrate who sits in the ordinary criminal court goes and sits in the Juvenile Court and mechanically tries cases against children.\\nIt is absolutely essential, and this is something which we wish to impress upon the State Governments with all the earnestness at our command, that they must set up Juvenile Courts, one in each district, and there must be special cadre of Magistrates who must be suitably trained for dealing with cases against children.\\nThey may also do other criminal work, if the work of the Juvenile Court is not sufficient to engage then fully, but they must have proper and adequate training for dealing with cases against Juveniles, because these cases require a different type of procedure and qualitatively a different kind of approach.\\nWe would also direct that where a complaint is filed or first information report is lodged against a child below the age of 16 years for an offence punishable with imprisonment of not more than 7 years, the investigation shall be completed within a period of three months from the date of filing of the complaint or lodging of the First Information Report and if the investigation is not completed within this time, the case against the child must be treated as closed.\\nIf within three months, the chargesheet is filed against the child in case of an offence punishable with imprisonment of not more than 7 years, the case must be tried and disposed of within a further period of 6 months at the outside and this period should be inclusive of the time taken up in committal proceedings, if any.\\nWe have already held in Hussainara Khatoon & Ors.\\nvs Home Secretary, State of Bihar, [1979] 3 SCR 169 that the right to speedy trial is a fundamental right implicit in article 21 of the Constitution.\\nIf an accused is not tried speedily and his case remains pending before the Magistrate or the Sessions Court for an unreasonable length of time, it is clear that his fundamental right to speedy trial would be violated unless, of course, the trial is held up on account of some interim order passed by a superior court or the accused is responsible for the delay in the trial of the case.\\nThe consequence of violation of the fundamental right to speedy trial would be that the prosecution itself would be liable to be quashed on the ground that it is in breach of the fundamental right.\\nOne of the primary reasons why trial of criminal cases is delayed in the courts of Magistrates and Additional Sessions Judges is the total inadequacy of judge strength and lack of satisfactory working conditions for Magistrates and Additional Sessions Judges.\\nThere are courts of Magistrates and Additional Sessions Judges where the workload is so heavy that it is just not 567 possible to cope with the workload, unless there is increase in the strength of Magistrates and Additional Sessions Judges.\\nThere are instances where appointments of Magistrates and Additional Sessions Judges are held up for years and the courts have to work with depleted strength and this affects speedy trial of criminal cases.\\nThe Magistrates and Additional Sessions Judges are often not provided adequate staff and other facilities which would help improve their disposal of cases.\\nWe are, therefore, firmly of the view that every State Government must take necessary measures for the purpose of setting up adequate number of courts, appointing requisite number of Judges and providing them the necessary facilities.\\nIt is also necessary to set up an Institute or Academy for training of Judicial officers so that their efficiency may be improved and they may be able to regulate and control the flow of cases in their respective courts.\\nThe problem of arrears of criminal cases in the courts of Magistrates and Additional Sessions Judges has assumed rather disturbing proportions and it is a matter of grave urgency to which no State Government can afford to be oblivious.\\nBut, here, we are not concerned with the question of speedy trial for an accused who is not a child below the age of 16 years.\\nThat is a question which may have to be considered in some other case where this Court may be called upon to examine as to what is reasonable length of time for trial beyond which the court would regard the right to speedy trial as violated.\\nSo far as a child accused of an offence punishable with imprisonment of not more than 7 years is concerned, we would regard a period of 3 months from the date of filing of the complaint or lodging of the First Information Report as the maximum time permissible for investigation and a period of 6 months from the filing of the charge sheet as a reasonable period within which the trial of the child must be completed.\\nIf that is not done, the prosecution against the child would be liable to be quashed.\\nWe would direct every State Government to give effect to this principle or norm laid down by us in so far as any future cases are concerned, but so far as concerns pending cases relating to offences punishable with imprisonment of not more than 7 years, we would direct every State Government to complete the investigation within a period of 3 months from today if the investigation has not already resulted in filing of chargesheet and if a chargesheet has been filed, the trial shall be completed within a period of 6 months from today and if it is not, the prosecution shall be quashed.\\nWe have by our order dated 5th August 1986 called upon the State Government to bring into force and to implement vigorously the 568 provisions of the Children \\'s Acts enacted in the various States.\\nBut we would suggest that instead of each State having its own Children \\'s Act in other States.\\nit would be desirable if the Central Government initiates Parliamentary Legislation on the subject, so that there is complete uniformity in regard to the various provisions relating to children in the entire territory of the country.\\nThe Children \\'s Act which may be enacted by Parliament should contain not only provisions for investigation and trial of offences against children below the age of 16 years but should also contain mandatory provisions for ensuring social, economic and psychological rehabilitation of the children who are either accused of offences or are abandoned or destitute or lost.\\nMoreover, it is not enough merely to have legislation on the subject, but it is equally, if not more, important to ensure that such legislation is implemented in all earnestness and mere lip sympathy is not paid such legislation and justification .\\nfor non implementation is not pleaded on ground of lack of finances on the part of the State.\\nThe greatest recompense which the State can get for expenditure on children is the building up of a powerful human resource ready to take its place in the forward march of the nation.\\nWe have already given various directions by our orders dated 12th July 1986 and 5th August 1986.\\nWe have also in the meantime received reports of survey made by several District Judges.\\nWe shall take up these matters for consideration at the next hearing of the writ petition which shall take place on 1.9.1986.\\n [/INST] On 12th July, 1986 this Court issued various directions in regard to the physically and mentally retarded children as also abandoned or destitute children who are

376 of 1957.\\nA.N. Sinha and P.K. Mukherjee, for the appellant M.C. Setalvad, Sukumar Ghose and B.N. Ghosh, for the respondent.\\nOctober 4, 1963.\\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO J.\\nThis is an appeal on a certificate granted by the Calcutta High Court.\\nThe respondent, the Calcutta Tramways Co. Ltd., is running tramcars in the city of Calcutta.\\nIt gets electricity in bulk from the Calcutta Electric Supply Company and gets the same converted from alternate current to direct current at a high voltage for electric traction for running tram cars of the company.\\nFor this purpose it has an electric transformer house in 129/4 A and 130 D, Cornwallis Street.\\nThe appellant Corporation was of opinion that the premises were being used for a purpose which was dangerous to life, health or property and was likely to create a nuisance.\\nIt therefore ordered the respondent to take out a licence under section 437 (1) (b) of the Calcutta Municipal Act, No. XXXIII of 1951, (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and fixed a fee therefore.\\nThe respondent however refused to take out a licence and consequently it was prosecuted under section 537 of the Act.\\nThe respondent raised a number of points in defence, namely, (i) that the prosecution had not been properly filed; (ii) that the electric transformer house was neither a factory nor a place of trade, nor a place of public resort and therefore section 437 (1) (b) had no application; (iii) that the use of the transformer house for converting high voltage alternate current into low and medium pressure direct current was neither a use which was dangerous to life, health or property nor the same was likely to create a nuisance; and (iv) that as section 437 (1) (b) of the Act vests absolute power in the Corporation to form the opinion required thereunder, it was an unreasonable restriction on the freedom of trade 28 guaranteed under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution and therefore that provision is unconstitutional.\\nThe Magistrate held that the complaint was properly filed.\\nHe further held that the transformer house.\\nwas meant for the trade which the respondent was carrying on and therefore was covered by section 437 (1) (b).\\nHe also held that the Corporation had properly formed the opinion that the use of the transformer house was likely to be dangerous to life, health or property and was also likely to create a nuisance.\\nHe further seems to have held that even though section 437 (1) (b)made the opinion of the Corporation conclusive and final, there could be no doubt that the use of the transformer house was dangerous to life, health or property and was likely to create a nuisance.\\nFinally he seems to have held that section 437 (1) (b) as it stood was not unconstitutional.\\nHe therefore convicted the respondent and sentenced it to a fine of Rs. 100 only.\\nThe respondent then went in revision to the High Court, and the main point urged there was that the provisions of section 437 (1) (b) were unconstitutional.\\nThe High Court held that inasmuch section 437 (1) (b) made the opinion of the Corporation conclusive and not liable to be challenged in any court, the provision was unconstitutional inasmuch as it amounted to an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right enshrined in article 19 (1) (g).\\nThe High Court further held that the provision with respect to the conclusiveness and non justiciability of the opinion of the Corporation was so embedded in section 437 (1) (b) that it was not severable and therefore it struck down section 437 (1) (b) as a whole as unconstitutional.\\nAnother point which was urged before the High Court was that the fee of Rs. 500 was in the nature of a tax which neither the State Legislature nor the Corporation of Calcutta could levy.\\nThe High Court did not decide this question in view of its decision on the constitutionality of section 437 (1) (b).\\nThe present appeal has been brought to this Court by the appellant on a certificate granted by the High Court.\\n29 Two main questions therefore that arise for our decision are: (1) whether the provision in section 437 (1) (b) which makes the opinion of the Corporation conclusive and non justiciable in any court amounts to an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on trade etc.\\nenshrined in article 19 (1) (g); and (2) even if it be so, whether the provision relating to conclusiveness and non justiciability is severable or not.\\nSection 437 (1) (b) reads as follows: \"(1) No person shall use or permit or suffer to be used any premises for any of the following purposes without or otherwise than in conformity with the terms of a licence granted by the Commissioner in this behalf, namely, (a) (b) any purpose which is, in the opinion of the Corporation (which opinion shall be conclusive and shall not be challenged in any court) dangerous to life, health or property, or likely to create a nuisance; (c) The contention on behalf of the appellant is that even though the opinion of the Corporation has been made conclusive and non justiciable, the restriction on trade resulting from the imposition of licence fee on the basis of such conclusiveness and non justiciability is a reasonable restriction in the interest of the general public.\\nOn the other hand it has been urged on behalf of the respondent that by making the opinion of the Corporation in such matters conclusive and non justiciable, the law makes it possible that any opinion of the Corporation, howsoever capricious or unreasonable it may be, must prevail and therefore the provision is an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on any trade etc.\\nenshrined in article 19 (1) (g).\\nReliance in this connection has been placed on the decision of this Court in Joseph Kuruvilla Vellukunnel vs The Reserve Bank of India.(1) It is urged that the mere fact that the opinion of the Corporation has been made con (1) [1962] Supp.\\n3 S.C.R. 632 30 clusive and non justiciable would not make the provision unreasonable with respect to carrying on any trade etc.\\nIn that case, section 38 (1) of the Banking Companies Act, provided that notwithstanding anything contained in the , the High Court shall order the winding up of a banking company, if an application for its winding up has been made by the Reserve Bank under section 37, or this section.\\nIt was urged in that case that the provision amounted to an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on banking as the whole procedure was a denial of the principles of natural justice, chiefly as it denied access to courts, for ordinarily it was for the court to be satisfied after a fair trial that an order of winding up a company was called for and the court was free to.\\nreach a decision after the company had shown cause and there was also a right of appeal against such decision.\\nThis Court held by a majority that in view of the history of the establishment of the Reserve Bank as a central bank for India, its position as a banker \\'s bank, its control over banking companies and banking in India, its position as the issuing bank, its power to license banking companies and cancel their licences and numerous other powers, the provision could not be challenged as unreasonable as the Reserve Bank makes an application for winding up only where it is satisfied that it was necessary to wind up a tottering or unsafe banking company in the interest of the depositors.\\nWe are of opinion that the decision in that case must be confined to the very special circumstances of the trade of banking, which is a very sensitive credit organisation and to the very special position the Reserve Bank occupies in the banking world in this country.\\nThat decision cannot be extended as a matter of course to other cases where substantially similar provisions are made in other laws relating to exclusion of the jurisdiction of courts.\\nIn other cases of this kind, the question has to be examined on the merits in each case to see whether the restriction created by conclusiveness and non justiciability is a reasonable restriction in the circumstances of the particular case.\\n31 We must therefore proceed to consider whether in the circumstances of this case the restriction contained in the parenthetical clause ins.\\n437 (1) (b) by which the opinion of the Corporation has been made conclusive and non justiciable, can be said to be a reasonable restriction on the right to carry on trade etc.\\nenshrined in article 19 (1) (g).\\nIn Dr. N.B. Khare vs The State of Delhi,(1) this Court held that a law providing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the rights conferred by article 19 may contain substantive provisions as well as procedural provisions and the court has to consider the reasonableness of the substantive provisions as well as the procedural part of the law.\\nThe parenthetical clause which makes the 6pinion of the Corporation conclusive and non justiciable is in the nature of a procedural provision and we have to see whether in the circumstances of this case such a procedural provision is reasonable in the interest of the general public.\\nIt has been urged that the Corporation which is an elected body would exercise the power conferred on it under section 437 (1) (b) reasonably and therefore the provision must be considered to be a reasonable provision.\\nThis in our opinion is no answer to the question whether the provision is reasonable or not.\\nIt is of course true that malafide exercise of the power conferred on the Corporation would be struck down on that ground alone; but it is not easy to prove mala fide, and in many cases it may be that the Corporation may act reasonably under the provision but it may equally be that knowing that its opinion is conclusive and non justiciable it may not so act, even though there may be no mala fides.\\nThe vice in the provision is that it makes the opinion of the Corporation, howsoever capricious or arbitrary or howsoever unreasonable on the face of it may be, conclusive and non justiciable.\\nThe conferment of such a power on a municipal body which has the effect of, imposing restrictions on carrying on trade etc.\\ncannot in our opinion be said to be a reasonable restriction within the meaning of article (1) ; 32 19 (6).\\nSuch a provision puts carrying on trade by those residing within the limits of the municipal Corporation entirely at its mercy, if it chooses to exercise that power capriciously, arbitrarily or unreasonably, though not mala fide.\\nWe therefore agree with the High Court that the conferment of such a power on the Corporation as it stands in the parenthetical clause in section 437 (1),(b) must be held to be an unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on trade etc.\\nThis brings us to the next question whether this parenthetical clause is severable from the rest of the provision.\\nIn this connection it may be observed that in the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1923, which was repealed by the Act, the corresponding provision was contained in section 386 and there was no provision making the opinion of the Corporation conclusive and non justiciable.\\nIn similar provisions of other laws also there is no provision making the opinion of the Corporation conclusive and non justiciable.\\nIn the Madras City Municipal Act, No. IV of 1919, there was a similar provision in section 287 read with Sch.\\nVI, which provided for licences where a place was used for any purpose in any area which in the opinion of the Commissioner was likely to be dangerous to human life or was likely to create or cause nuisance.\\nSimilarly in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, No. 66 of 1957, there is a provision in section 417 (1) which provides that no person shall use or permit to be used any premises for any purpose which in the opinion of the Commissioner was dangerous to life, health or property or likely to create a nuisance.\\nWe have referred to these Acts and the provision in the Calcutta Municipal Act which was the predecessor of the Act to show that it is quite possible to work such a provision without the opinion of the Corporation being made conclusive and non justiciable.\\nThe question therefore is whether this provision contained in the parenthetical clause in section 437 (1) (b) can be severed from the rest of the provision.\\n33 The principles governing severability were considered by this Court in R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla vs The Union of India.(1) Seven principles were there laid down in that connection, of which three are material for our purpose, namely \" (1) In determining whether the valid parts of ,1.\\nstatute are separable from the invalid parts thereof, it is the intention of the legislature that is the determining factor.\\nThe test to be applied is whether the legislature would have enacted the valid part if it had known that the rest of the statute was invalid. \"(2) If the valid and invalid provisions are so inextricably mixed up that they cannot be separated from one another, then the invalidity of a portion must result in the invalidity of the Act in its entirety.\\nOn the other hand if they are \"so distinct and separate that after striking out what is invalid, what remains is in itself a complete code independent of the rest then it will be upheld notwithstanding that the rest has become unenforceable\". \"(3) Even when the provisions which are valid are distinct and separate from those which are invalid, if they all form part of a single scheme which is intended to be operative as a whole, then also the invalidity of a part will result in the failure of the whole.\\n\" Learned counsel for the appellant urges that the parenthetical clause in section 437 (1) (b)is severable in view of the first two principles set out above.\\nOn the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent urges that in view of the third principle the parenthetical clause with respect to conclusiveness and non justiciability is not severable.\\nThe High Court has also taken the view that even if the parenthetical clause is distinct and separate from the rest of the provision, the whole provision contained in section 437 (1) (b) constitutes a single scheme intended to be operative (1) [1957] S.C.R. 093 1 SCI/64 3 34 as a whole and therefore section 437 (1) (b) must be struck down.\\nWe are of opinion that the view taken by the High Court is not correct.\\nWe have already pointed out that such a provision did riot exist in the earlier Act relating to this very Corporation and it is no one \\'s case that without such provision the earlier provision did not work.\\nThe first question therefore is whether it was the intention of the legislature when it passed section 437 (1) (b) that if it knew that the parenthetical clause was invalid it would not have enacted the rest of section 437 (1) (b).\\nThe answer to this question in our opinion can only be one.\\nIn view of the corresponding provision in the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1923, we cannot accept that the Legislature would not have provided for the licensing of premises which in the opinion of the Corporation were used for purposes which were dangerous to life, health or property or were likely to create a nuisance, unless that opinion was to be conclusive and non justiciable.\\nSimilar provision had existed in the earlier law without the provision relating to conclusiveness and non justiciability in respect of using premises for purposes which were dangerous to life health or property or were likely to create a nuisance.\\nSuch a provision in our opinion is a very reasonable provision in the interest of the general public and we do not see why it should be held that the Legislature would not have enacted such a provision unless the opinion of the Corporation was also to become conclusive and non justiciable.\\nThe first proposition out of the three set out above is in our opinion clearly applicable to this case and we have no doubt that the Legislature would have enacted the provision contained in section 437 (1) (b) without the parenthetical clause.\\nSo far as the second principle is concerned, we are of opinion that the valid and invalid provisions in section 437 (1) (b) are not so inextricably mixed that they cannot be separated.\\nOn the other hand we are of opinion that they are distinct and separate 35 and even if we strike out the parenthetical clause as to conclusiveness and non justiciability what remains is in itself a complete code for the particular purpose independent of the invalid part.\\nTherefore, the remaining provision contained in section 437 (1) (b) can and should be upheld notwithstanding that the parenthetical clause providing for conclusiveness and non justiciability is invalid.\\nFinally we are of opinion that the third proposition does not apply in the present case.\\nThat proposition applies only where the valid and the invalid provisions even when they are separate and distinct form part of a single scheme which is intended to be operative as a whole;if that is really so, then the whole must go and there is no question of severability.\\nBut making a certain opinion conclusive and non justiciable is a separate matter altogether and it cannot be said that it is so embedded in section 437 (1) (b) as to make conclusiveness and non justiciability of the opinion of the Corporation a part of the scheme for licensing which is provided therein.\\nAs we read section 437 (1) (b) it cannot be said that the whole of it is a part of a single scheme which was intended to be operative as one whole.\\nThis is really another aspect of the first proposition relating to the intention of the Legislature and it seems to us that the scheme in section 437 (1) (b) is not such a single scheme that it must be said that the Legislature must have intended it to be operative as a whole.\\nWe see no difficulty in holding that the provision in the parenthetical clause cannot be said to be part of a single scheme of such a nature that either the whole must be operative or nothing at all.\\nWe are therefore of opinion that the parenthetical clause consisting of the words \"which opinion shall be conclusive and shall not be challenged in any court\" is severable from the rest of section 437 (1) (b) and therefore only these words of this section can be struck down and not the whole of the section.\\nIt may be added that the respondent does not rely on any of the remaining principles set out in R.M.D. Chamarbaugwalla \\'s case.(1) (1) ; 36 The order of the High Court striking down the whole of section 437 (1) (b) must therefore be set aside and only the portion in parenthesis which makes the opinion of the Corporation conclusive and non justiciable struck down as an unreasonable restriction \\' on the right to carry on trade etc.\\nunder article 19 (1) (g).\\nIn the view we have taken the judgment of the High Court must be set aside.\\nIt has been urged on behalf of the respondent that as the Magistrate dealt with the matter on the looting that the opinion of the Corporation was conclusive and non justiciable it should be given an opportunity to show before the Magistrate that the opinion of the Corporation that the purpose for which the premises in this case were used was dangerous to life, health or property or was likely to create a nuisance was wrong.\\nIt is also urged that the point whether the impost in this particular case was a fee properly so called or a tax which was taken before the High Court arises in this case and opportunity should be given to the respondent to raise this point before the Magistrate.\\nIn view of this contention we set aside the order of the Magistrate also and remand the case to him for decision according to law, including the above two points.\\nThe parties will be at liberty to adduce such relevant evidence as they think fit to do.\\nCase remanded.\\n [/INST] The respondent company got its supply of electricity from the Calcutta Electric Supply Co., converted the same from alternate current to direct current in its transformer house for running its tram cars.\\nThe appellant Corporation was of opinion that the use of the premises as transformer house was dangerous to life, health and property and was likely to cause a nuisance and asked the respondent to take a licence under section 437(1)(b) of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1951.\\nThe respondent refused to do so and was therefore prosecuted under section 537 of the Act.\\nThe trial Magistrate held in favour of the appellant and convicted the respondent and sentenced it to pay a fine of Rs. 100 only.\\nThe respondent moved 26 the High Court in revision.\\nThat Court held that the provision in s, 437(1) (b) which made the opinion the Corporation conclusive and non justiciable unreasonably restricted the fundamental right enshrined in article 19(1) (g) of the Constitution and since that provision was inseverable the entire section was unconstitutional.\\nThe corporation appealed to this Court.\\nSection 437(1)(b) of the Act provided as follows \\' \"(1) No person shall use or permit or suffer to be used any premises for any of the following purposes without or otherwise than in conformity with the terms of a licence granted by the Commissioner in this behalf, namely, (a) (b) any purpose which is, in the opinion of the Corporation (which opinion shall be conclusive and shall not be challenged in any court) dangerous to life, health or property, or likely to create a nuisance.\\n\" Held: The power conferred on the Corporation by section 437(1)(b) of the Calcutta Municipal Act, 1951, in the parenthetical clause \"which opinion shall be conclusive and shall not be challenged in any court\" which was in the nature of a procedural provision, was an unreasonable restriction within the meaning of article 19(6) of the Constitution and must be struck down.\\nThe clause makes the opinion of the Corporation, however unreasonable, capricious and arbitrary, conclusive and non justiciable and thereby places trade and business within the municipal limits entirely at the mercy of the Corporation, even though it may not act mala fide.\\nThe decision of this Court in Joseph Kuruvilla Vellukunnel vs Reserve Bank of India, must be confined to the special circumstances of the trade of banking and cannot be extended as a matter of course to other cases involving substantially similar provisions and each case should be judged on its own merits.\\nJoseph Kuruvilla Vellukunnel vs The Reserve Bank of India, [1962] Supp.\\n3 S.C.R. 632, held inapplicable.\\nSo judged in the light of the principles laid down by this Court, the parenthetical clause was severable from the rest of the section and, consequently, that clause alone, and not the entire section should be struck down.\\nThe scheme of the section was not so integrated as to indicate that the Legislature wanted it to be operative as a whole.\\nDr. N.B.

No. 58/8 of 1948 /50 filed by Kailash Rai against the appellants in regard to the same.\\nA decree had been pawed on December 16, 1950, in that title suit dismissing the claim of Kailash Rai.\\nAn appeal had been filed by Kailash Rai against that decree and that appeal was pending at the date of the occurrence.\\nOn March 4, 1951, Kailash Rai was sitting in the Palani and at about 3 to 4 p.m. a mob consisting of about 100 to 125 persons including the appellants all armed with lathes, bhallas and pharsas came to the Palani and began to demolish the same.\\nKailash Rai remonstrated and the deceased appellant No. 1, ordered that the Palai should be set on fire.\\nThe appellant No. 2 thereupon set fire to the Palani with a match stick and the appellant No. 3 set fire to the Punjaul.\\nThe first information report of this occurrence was lodged at Gopalganj Police Station at 8 p.m. the same night.\\nThe officer in charge of Gopalganj Police Station investigated the case and 276 challaned the appellants charging them with having committed, offences under sections 435 and 436 of the Indian Penal Code.\\nThe Committing Court found a prima facie case made out against the appellants and sent them up for trial by the Assistant Sessions Judge, Second Court, Chapra, who tried them by a jury.\\nThe jury returned a majority verdict of guilty against the appellants.\\nThe Assistant Sessions Judge, however, disagreed with that verdict and made a reference to the High Court stating in the letter of reference that on the evidence recorded before him the appellants had been in possession of the Palani and the Punjaul but were dispossessed of the same some time prior to the passing of the decree in the title suit on December 16,1950, and were therefore justified in taking steps for recovery of possession thereof from Kailash Rai on March 4, 195 1, and if in that process the appellants set fire to the Palani and the Punjaul they were only destroying their own property and were not guilty of the offence of committing mischief by fire as alleged by the prosecution.\\nThe Assistant Sessions Judge tried to analyse the working of the minds of the jury in arriving at the verdict which they did and though he agreed with the alleged finding of fact reached by the jury in regard to the possession of the Palani and the Punjaul, disagreed with the law as allegedly applied by the jury and therefore disagreed with the majority verdict.\\nWhen the reference was heard before the High Court, the counsel for the appellants only contended that the charge addressed by the Assistant Sessions Judge to the jury was defective and he did not invite the High Court, as he should have done, to consider the entire evidence and to acquit or convict the appellants of the offences of which the jury could have convicted them upon the charges framed and placed before it, after giving due weight to the opinions of the learned Sessions Judge and the jury as required by a. 307 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\nThe High Court, therefore, only considered the objections which had been urged by the learned counsel for the appellants before it in regard to the charge being defective and 277 overruled them, accepted the majority verdict, convicted the appellants and sentenced them as above.\\nWe are of opinion that in so doing the High Court was clearly in error and acted in violation of the provisions of section 307 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\\nSection 307 (3) provides: In dealing with the case so submitted the High Court may exercise any of the powers which it may exercise on an appeal, and subject thereto it shall, after considering the entire evidence and after giving due weight to the opinions of the Sessions Judge and the jury, acquit or convict such accused of any offence of which the jury could have convicted him upon the charge framed and placed before it;

J.\\nThis is a petition under article 32 of the Constitution, preferred by six persons, who purport to carry on the business of preparing, printing, publishing and, selling text books for different classes in the schools of Punjab, particularly for the primary and middle classes, under the name and style \"Uttar Chand Kapur & Sons\".\\nIt is alleged that the Education Department of the Punjab Government has in pursuance of their so called policy of nationalisation of text books, issued a series of notifications since 1950 regarding the printing, publication and sale of these books which have not only placed unwarrantable restrictions upon the rights of the petitioners to carry on their business but have practically ousted them and other fellow traders from the business altogether.\\nIt is said that no restrictions could be imposed upon the petitioners \\' right to carry on the trade which is guaranteed under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution by mere executive orders without proper legislation and that the legislation, if any, must conform to the requirements of clause (6) of article 19 of the Constitution.\\nAccordingly, the petitioners pray for writs in the nature of mandamus directing the Punjab Government to withdraw the notifications which have affected their rights.\\nTo appreciate the contentions that have been raised by the learned counsel who appeared for the parties before us, it will be necessary to narrate certain relevant facts.\\nIn the State of Punjab, all recognised schools have got to follow the course of studies approved by the Education Department of the Government and the use, by the pupils, of the text books prescribed or authorised by the Department is a con dition precedent to the granting of recognition to a 228 school.\\nFor a long period of time prior to 1950, the method adopted by the Government for selection and approval of text books for recognised schools was commonly known as the alternative method and the procedure followed was shortly this: Books on relevant subjects, in accordance with the principles laid down by the Education Department, were prepared by the publishers with their own money and under their own arrangements and they were submitted for approval of the Government.\\nThe Education Department after proper scrutiny selected books numbering between 3 and 10 or even more on each subject as alternative text books, leaving it to the discretion of the Head Masters of the different schools, to select any one of the alternative books on a particular subject out of the approved list.\\nThe Government fixed the prices as well as the size and contents of the books and when these things were done it was left to the publishers to print, publish and sell the books to the pupils of different schools according to the choice made by their respective Head Masters.\\nAuthors, who were not pub lishers, could also submit books for approval and if any of their books were approved, they had to make arrangements for publishing the same and usually they used to select some one of the publishers already on the line to do the work.\\nThis procedure, which was in vogue since 1905, was altered in material particulars on and from May 1950.\\nBy certain resolutions of the Government passed on or about that time, the whole of the territory of Punjab, as it remained in the Indian Union after partition, was divided into three Zones.\\nThe text books on certain subjects like agriculture, history, social studies, etc.\\nfor all the zones were prepared and published by the Government without inviting them from the publishers.\\nWith respect to the remaining subjects, offers were still invited from \"publishers and authors\" but the alternative system was given up and only one text book on each subject for each class in a particular zone was selected.\\nAnother change introduced at this time was that the Government charged, as royalty, 5% on the sale price of all the 229 approved text books.\\nThe result therefore was that the Government at this time practically took upon themselves the monopoly of publishing the textbooks on some of the subjects and with regard to the rest also, they reserved for themselves a certain royalty upon the sale proceeds.\\nChanges of a far more drastic character however were introduced in the year 1952 by a notification of the Education Department issued on the 9th of August 1952 and it is against this notification that the complaints of the petitioners are mainly directed.\\nThis notification omitted the word \"publishers\" altogether and invited only the \"authors and others\" to submit books for approval by the Government.\\nThese \"authors and others\", whose books were selected, bad to enter into agreements in the form prescribed by the Government and the principal terms of the agreement were that the copyright in these books would vest absolutely in the Government and the \"authors and others\" would only get a royalty at the rate of 5% on the sale of the text books at the price or prices specified in the list.\\nThus the publishing, printing and selling of the books were taken by the Government exclusively in their own hands and the private publishers were altogether ousted from this business.\\nThe 5% royalty, in substance, represents the price for the sale of the copyright and it is paid to an author or any other person who, not being the author, is the owner of the copyright and is hence competent in law to transfer the same to the Government.\\nIt is against these notifications of 1950 and 1952 that the present petition under article 32 of the Constitution is directed and the petitioners pray for withdrawal of these notifications on the ground that they contravene the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under the Constitution.\\nThe contentions raised by Mr. Pathak, who appeared in support of the petitioners, are of a three fold character.\\nIt is contended in the first place that the executive Government of a State is wholly incompetent, without any legislative sanction, to engage in any trade or business activity and that the acts of 230 the Government in carrying out their policy of establishing monopoly in the business of printing and publishing text books for school students is wholly without jurisdiction and illegal.\\nHis second contention is, that assuming that the State could create a monopoly in its favour in respect of a particular trade or business, that could be done not by any executive act but by means of a proper legislation which should conform to the requirements of article 19(6) of the Constitution.\\nLastly, it is argued that it was not open to the Government to deprive the petitioners of their interest in any business or undertaking which amounts to property without authority of law and without payment of compensation as is required under article 31 of the Constitution.\\nThe first point raised by Mr. Pathak, in substance, amounts to this, that the Government has no power in law to carry on the business of printing or selling text books for the use of school students in competition with private agencies without the sanction of the legislature.\\nIt is not argued that the functions of a modern State like the police States of old are confined to mere collection of taxes or maintenance of laws and protection of the realm from external or internal enemies.\\nA modern State is certainly expected to engage in all activities necessary for the promotion of the social and economic welfare of the community.\\nWhat Mr. Pathak says, however, is, that as our Constitution clearly recognises a division of governmental functions into three categories, viz., the legislative, the judicial and the executive, the function of the executive cannot but be to execute the laws passed by the legislature or to supervise the enforcement of the same.\\nThe legislature must first enact a measure which the executive can then carry out.\\nThe learned counsel has, in support of this contention, placed considerable reliance upon articles 73 and 162 of our Constitution and also upon certain decided authorities of the Australian High Court to which we shall presently refer.\\nArticle 73 of the Constitution relates to the executive powers of the Union, while the corresponding 231 provision in regard to the executive powers of a State is contained in article 162.\\nThe provisions of these articles are analogous to those of sections 8 and 49 (2) respectively of the Government of India Act, 1935 and lay down the rule of distribution of executive powers between the Union and the States, following, the same analogy as is provided in regard to the distribution of legislative powers between them.\\nArticle 162, with which we are directly concerned in this case, lays down: \"Subject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws: Provided that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of a State and Parliament have power to make laws, the executive power of the State shall be subject to, and limited by, the executive power expressly conferred by this Constitution or by any law made by Parliament upon the Union or authorities thereof\".\\nThus under this article the executive authority of the State is exclusive in respect to matters enumerated in List II of Seventh Schedule.\\nThe authority also extends to the Concurrent List except as provided in the Constitution itself or in any law passed by the Parliament.\\nSimilarly, article 73 provides that the executive powers of the Union shall extend to matters with respect to which the Parliament has power to make laws and to the exercise of such rights, authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable by the Govern ment of India by virtue of any treaty or any agreement.\\nThe proviso engrafted on clause (1) further lays down that although with regard to the matters in the Concurrent List the executive authority shall be ordinarily left to the State it would be open to the Parliament to provide that in exceptional cases the executive power of the Union shall extend to these matters also.\\nNeither of these articles contain any definition as to what the executive function is and what activities would legitimately come within its scope.\\nThey are concerned primarily with the distri 232 bution of the executive power between the Union on the one hand and the States on the other.\\nThey do not mean, as Mr. Pathak seems to suggest, that it is only when the Parliament or the State Legislature has legislated on certain items appertaining to their respective lists, that the Union or the State executive, as the case may be, can proceed to function in respect to them.\\nOn the other hand, the language of article 162 clearly indicates that the powers of the State executive do extend to matters upon which the State Legislature is competent to legislate and are not con fined to matters over which legislation has been passed already.\\nThe same principle underlies article 73 of the Constitution.\\nThese provisions of the Constitution therefore do not lend any support to Mr. Pathak \\'s contention.\\nThe Australian cases upon which reliance has been placed by the learned counsel do not, in our opinion, appear to be of much help either.\\nIn the first(1) of these cases, the executive Government of the Commonwealth during the continuance of the war, entered into a number of agreements with a company which was engaged in the manufacture and sale of wool tops.\\nThe agreements were of different types.\\nBy one class of agreements, the Commonwealth Government gave consent to the sale of wool tops by the company in return for a share of the profits of the transactions (called by the parties \"a licence fee\").\\nAnother class provided that the business of manufacturing wool tops should be carried on by the company as agents for the Commonwealth in consideration of the company receiving an annual sum from the Commonwealth.\\nThe rest of the agreements were a combination of these two varieties.\\nIt was held by a Full Bench of the High Court that apart from any authority conferred by an Act of Parliament or by regulations thereunder, the executive Government of the Commonwealth had no power to make or ratify any of these agreements.\\nThe decision, it may be noticed, was based substantially upon the provision of section 61 of the Australian Constitution which is worded as follows: (1) The Commtmonwwealth and the Central Wool Committee vs The Colonial Combining, Spinning and Weaving Co. Ltd., ; 233 \"The executive power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen and is exercised by the Governor General as the Queen \\'s representative and extends to the execution and maintenance of the Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth\", In addition to this, the King could assign other functions and powers to the Governor General under section 2 but in this particular case no assignment of any additional powers was alleged or proved.\\nThe court held that the agreements were not directly authorised by the Parliament or under the provisions of any statute and as they were not for the execution and maintenance of the Constitution they must be held to be void.\\nIsacs, J., in his judgment, dealt elabo rately with the two types of agreements and held that the agreements, so far as they purported to bind the company to pay to the Government money, as the price of consents, amounted to the imposition of a tax and were void without the authority of Parliament.\\nThe other kind of agreements which purported to bind the Government to pay to the company a remuneration for manufacturing wool tops was held to be an appropriation of public revenue and being without legislative authority was also void.\\nIt will be apparent that none of the principles indicated above could have any application to the circumstances of the present case.\\nThere is no provision in our Constitution corresponding to section 61 of the Australian Act.\\nThe Government has not imposed anything like taxation or licence fee in the present case nor have we been told that the appropriation of public revenue involved in the so called business in text books carried on by the Government has not been sanctioned by the legislature by proper Appropriation Acts.\\nThe other case(1) is of an altogether different character and arose in the following way.\\nThe Commonwealth Government had established a clothing factory in Melbourne for the purpose of making naval and military uniforms for the defence forces and (1) Vide Attorney General for Victoria vs The Commonwealth ; 30 234 postal employees.\\nIn times of peace the operations of the factory included the supply of uniforms for other departments of the Commonwealth and for employees in various public utility services.\\nThe Governor General deemed such peace time operations of the factory necessary for the efficient defence of the Commonwealth inasmuch as the maintenance intact of the trained complement of the factory would assist in meeting wartime demands.\\nA question arose as to whether operations of the factory for such purposes in peace: time were authorised by the Defence Act.\\nThe majority of the court answered the question in the affirmative.\\nStarke, J. delivered a dissenting opinion upon which Mr. Pathak mainly relied.\\nThe learned Judge laid stress on section 61 of the Constitution Act according to which the executive power of the Commonwealth extended to the maintenance of the Constitution and of the laws of the Commonwealth and held that there was nothing in the Constitution or any law of the Commonwealth which enabled the Commonwealth to establish and maintain clothing factories for other than Commonwealth purposes.\\nThe opinion, whether right or wrong, turns upon the particular facts of the case and upon the provision of section 61 of the Australian Act and it cannot and does not throw any light on the question that requires decision in the present case.\\nA question very similar to that in the present case did arise for consideration before a Full Bench of the Allahabad High Court in Motilal vs The Government of the State of Uttar Pradesh(1).\\nThe point canvassed there was whether the Government of a State has power under the Constitution to carry on the trade or business of running a bus service in the absence of a legislative enactment authorising the State Government to do so.\\nDifferent views were expressed by different Judges on this question.\\nChief Justice Malik was of opinion that in a written Constitution like ours the executive power may be such as is given to the executive or is implied, ancillary or inherent.\\n(1) A.I.R. 1951 Allahabad 257. 235 It must include all powers that may be needed to carry into effect the aims and objects of the Constitution.\\nIt must mean more than merely executing the laws.\\nAccording to the Chief Justice the State has a right to hold and manage its own property and carry on such trade or business as a citizen has the right to carry on, so long as such activity does not encroach upon the rights of others or is not contrary to law.\\nThe running of a transport business there fore was not per se outside the ambit of the executive authority of the State.\\nSapru, J. held that the power to run a Government bus service was incidental to the power of acquiring property which was expressly conferred by article 298 of the Constitution.\\nMootham and Wanchoo, JJ., who delivered a common judgment, were also of the opinion that there was no need for a specific legislative enactment to enable a State Government to run a bus service.\\nIn the opinion of these learned Judges an act would be within the executive power of the State if it is not an act which has been assigned by the Constitution of India to other authorities or bodies and is not contrary to the provisions of any law and does not encroach upon the legal rights of any member of the public.\\nAgarwala, J. dissented from the majority view and held that the State Government had no power to run a bus service in the absence of an Act of the legislature authorising the State to do so.\\nThe opinion of Agarwala J. undoubtedly supports the contention of Mr. Pathak but it appears to us to be too narrow and unsupportable.\\nIt may not be possible to frame an exhaustive definition of what executive function means and implies.\\nOrdinarily the executive power connotes the residue of governmental functions that remain after legislative and judicial functions are taken away.\\nThe Indian Constitution has not indeed recognised the doctrine of separation of powers in its absolute rigidity but the functions of the different parts or branches of the Government have been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can very well be said that our Constitution does not contemplate 236 assumption, by one organ or part of the State, of functions that essentially belong to another.\\nThe executive indeed can exercise the powers of departmental or subordinate legislation when such powers are delegated to it by the legislature.\\nIt can also, when so empowered, exercise judicial functions in a limited way.\\nThe executive Government, however, can never go against the provisions of the Constitution or of any law.\\nThis is clear from the provisions of article 154 of the Constitution but, as we have already stated, it does not follow from this that in order to enable the executive to function there must be a law already in existence and that the powers of the executive are limited merely to the carrying out of these laws.\\nThe limits within which the executive Government can function under the Indian Constitution can be ascertained without much difficulty by reference to the form of the executive which our Constitution has set up.\\nOur Constitution, though federal in its structure, is modelled on the British Parliamentary system where the executive is deemed to have the primary responsibility for the formulation of governmental policy and its transmission into law though the condition precedent to the exercise of this responsibility is its retaining the confidence of the legislative branch of the State.\\nThe executive function comprises both the determination of the policy as well as carrying it into execution.\\nThis evidently includes the initiation of legislation, the maintenance of order, the promotion of social and economic welfare, the direction of foreign policy, in fact the carrying on or supervision of the general administration of the State.\\nIn India, as in England, the executive has to act subject to the control of the legislature; but in what way is this control exercised by the legislature? Under article 53(1) of our Constitution, the executive power of the Union is vested in the President but under article 75 there is to be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the President in the exercise of his functions.\\nThe President has thus been made a formal or constitutional 237 head of the executive and the real executive powers are vested in the Ministers or the Cabinet.\\nThe same provisions obtain in regard to the Government of States; the Governor or the Rajpramukh, as the case may be, occupies the position of the head of the executive in the State but it is virtually the council of Ministers in each State that carries on the executive Government.\\nIn the Indian Constitution, therefore, we have the same system of parliamentary executive as in England and the council of Ministers consisting, as it does, of the members of the legislature is, like the British Cabinet, \"a hyphen which joins, a buckle which fastens the legislative part of the State to the executive part\".\\nThe Cabinet enjoying, as it does, a majority in the legislature concentrates in itself the virtual control of both legislative and executive func tions; and as the \\'Ministers constituting the Cabinet are presumably agreed on fundamentals and act on the principle of collective responsibility, the most important questions of policy are all formulated by them.\\nSuppose now that the Ministry or the executive Government of a State formulates a particular policy in furtherance of which they want to start a trade or business.\\nIs it necessary that there must be a specific legislation legalising such trade activities before they could be embarked upon? We cannot say that such legislation is always necessary.\\nIf the trade or business involves expenditure of funds, it is certainly required that Parliament should authorise such expenditure either directly or under the provisions of a statute.\\nWhat is generally done in such cases is, that the sums required for carrying on the business are entered in the annual financial statement which the Ministry has to lay before the House or Houses of Legislature in respect of every financial year under article 202 of the Constitution.\\nSo much of the esti mates as relate to expenditure other than those charged on the consolidated fund are submitted in the form of demands for grants to the legislature and the legislature has the power to assent or refuse to assent to any such demand or assent to a demand subject to reduc 238 tion of the amount (article 203).\\nAfter the grant is sanctioned, an Appropriation Bill is introduced to provide for the appropriation out of the consolidated fund of the State of all moneys required to meet the grants thus made by the Assembly (article 204).\\nAs soon as the Appropriation Act is passed, the expenditure made under the heads covered by it would be deemed to be properly authorised by law under article 266(3) of the Constitution.\\nIt may be, as Mr. Pathak contends, that the Appropriation Acts are no substitute for specific legislation and that they validate only the expenses out of the consolidated funds for the particular years for which they are passed; but nothing more than that may be necessary for carrying on of the trade or business.\\nUnder article 266(3) of the Constitution no moneys out of the consolidated funds of India or the consolidated fund of a State shall be appropriated except in accordance with law and for the purposes and in the manner provided in this Constitution.\\nThe expression \"law\" here obviously includes the Appro priation Acts.\\nIt is true that the Appropriation Acts cannot be said to give a direct legislative sanction to the trade activities themselves.\\nBut SO long as the trade activities are carried on in pursuance of the policy which the executive Government has formulated with the tacit support of the majority in, the legislature, no objection on the score of their not being sanctioned by specific legislative provision can possibly be raised.\\nObjections could be raised only in regard to the expenditure of public funds for carrying on of the trade or business and to these the Appropriation Acts would afford a complete answer.\\nSpecific legislation may indeed be necessary if the Government require certain powers in addition to what they possess under ordinary law in order to carry on the particular trade or business.\\nThus when it is necessary to encroach upon private rights in order to enable the Government to carry on their business, a specific legislation sanctioning such course would have to be passed.\\n239 In the present case it is not disputed that the entire expenses necessary for carrying on the business of printing and publishing the text books for recognised schools in Punjab were estimated and shown in the annual financial statement and that the demands for grants, which were made under different heads, were sanctioned by the State Legislature and due Appropriation Acts were passed.\\nFor the purpose of carrying on the business the Government do not require any additional powers and whatever is necessary for their purpose, they can have by entering into contracts with authors and other people.\\nThis power of contract is expressly vested in the Government under article 298 of the Constitution.\\nIn these circumstances, we are unable to agree with Mr. Pathak that the carrying on of the business of printing and publishing text books was beyond the competence of the executive Government without a specific legislation sanctioning such course.\\nThese discussions however are to some extent academic and are not sufficient by themselves to dispose of the petitioners \\' case.\\nAs we have said already, the executive Government are bound to conform not only to the law of the land but also to the provisions of the Constitution.\\nThe Indian Constitution is a written Constitution and even the legislature cannot override the fundamental rights guaranteed by it to the citizens.\\nConsequently, even if the acts of the executive are deemed to be sanctioned by the legislature, yet they can be declared to be void and inoperative if they infringe any of the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under Part III of the Consti tution.\\nOn the other hand, even if the acts of the executive are illegal in the sense that they are not warranted by law, but no fundamental rights of the petitioners have been infringed thereby, the latter would obviously have no right to complain under article 32 of the Constitution though they may have remedies elsewhere if other heads of rights are infringed.\\nThe material question for consideration therefore is: What fundamental rights of the petitioners, if any, have been violated by the notifications 240 and acts of the executive Government of Punjab undertaken by them in furtherance of their policy of nationalisation of the text books for the school students? The petitioners claim fundamental right under article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution which guarantees, inter alia, to all persons the right to carry on any trade or business.\\nThe business which the petitioners have been carrying on is that of printing and publishing books for sale including text books used in the primary and middle classes of the schools in Punjab.\\nOrdinarily it is for the school authorities to prescribe the text books that are to be used by the students and if these text books are available in the market the pupils can purchase them from any book seller they like.\\nThere is no fundamental right in the publishers that any of the books printed and published by them should be prescribed as text books by the school authorities or if they are once accepted as text books they cannot be stopped or discontinued in future.\\nWith regard to the schools which are recognised by the Government the position of the pub lishers is still worse.\\nThe recognised schools receive aids of various kinds from the Government including grants for the maintenance of the institutions, for equipment, furniture, scholarships and other things and the pupils of the recognised schools are admitted to the school final examinations at lower rates of fees than those demanded from the students of non recognised schools.\\nUnder the school code, one of the main conditions upon which recognition is granted by Government is that the school authorities must use as text books only those which are prescribed or autho rised by the Government.\\nSo far therefore as the recognised schools are concerned and we are concerned only with these schools in the present case the choice of text books rests entirely with the Government and it is for the Government to decide in which way the selection of these text books is to be made.\\nThe procedure hitherto followed was that the Government used to invite publishers and authors to submit their books for examination and approval by 241 the Education Department and after selection was made by the Government, the size, contents as well as the prices of the books were fixed and it was left to the publishers or authors to print and publish them and offer them for sale to the pupils.\\nSo long as this system was in vogue the only right which publishers, like the petitioners had, was to offer their books for inspection and approval by the Govern ment.\\nThey had no right to insist on any of their books being accepted as text books.\\nSo the utmost that could be said is that there was merely a chance or prospect of any or some of their books being approved as text books by the Government.\\nSuch chances are incidental to all trades and businesses and there is no fundamental right guaranteeing them.\\nA trader might be lucky in securing a particular market for his goods but if he loses that field because the particular customers for some reason or other do not choose to buy goods from him, it is not open to him to say that it was his fundamental right to have his old customers for ever.\\nOn the one hand, therefore, there was nothing but a chance or prospect which the publishers had of having their books approved by the Government, on the other hand the Government had the undisputed right to adopt any method of selection they liked and if they ultimately decided that after approving the text books they would purchase the copyright in them from the authors and others provided the latter were willing to transfer the same to the Government on certain terms, we fail to see what right of the publishers to carry on their trade or business is affected by it.\\nNobody is taking away the publishers \\' right to print and publish any books they like and to offer them for sale but if they have no right that their books should be approved as text books by the Government it is immaterial so far as they are concerned whether the Government approves of text books submitted by other persons who are willing to sell their copyrights in the books to them, or choose to engage authors for the purpose of preparing the text books which they take up on themselves to print 31 242 and publish.\\nWe are unable to appreciate the argument of Mr. Pathak that the Government while exercising their undoubted right of approval cannot attach to it a condition which has no bearing on the purpose for which the approval is made.\\nWe fail to see how the petitioners \\' position is in any way improved thereby.\\nThe action of the Government may be good or bad.\\nIt may be criticised and condemned in the Houses of the Legislature or outside but this does not amount to an infraction of the fundamental right guaranteed by article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution.\\nAs in our view the petitioners have no fundamental right in the present case which can be said to have been infringed by the action of the Government, the petition is bound to fail on that ground.\\nThis being the position, the other two points raised by Mr. Pathak do not require consideration at all.\\nAs the petitioners have no fundamental right under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution, the question whether the Government could establish a monopoly without any legislation under article 19(6) of the Constitution is altogether immaterial.\\nAgain a mere chance or prospect of having particular customers cannot be said to be a right to property or to any interest in an undertaking within the meaning of article 31(2) of the Constitution and no question of payment of compensation can arise because the petitioners have been deprived of the same.\\nThe result is that the petition is dismissed with costs.\\nPETITIONS NOS.\\n71 TO 77 AND 85 OF 1955.\\nMUKHERJEA C. J.\\nThese 8 petitions under article 32 of the Constitution raise identically the same points for consideration as are involved in Petition No. 652 of 1954 just disposed of.\\nThe petitioners in these cases also purport to be printers, publishers and sellers of text books for various classes in the schools of Punjab and they complain of infraction of their fundamental rights under article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution by reason of the various notifications issued by the State of Punjab in pursuance of their policy 243 of nationalisation of text books.\\nThe learned counsel appearing in these cases have adopted in their entirety the arguments that have been advanced by Mr. Pathak in Petition No. 652 of 1954 and no fresh or additional argument has been put forward by any one of them.\\nThis being the position the decision in Petition No. 652 of 1954 will govern these petitions also and they will stand dismissed but we would make no order as to costs.\\n [/INST] For a long period of time prior to 1950 the text books for recognised schools in the State of Punjab were prepared by private publishers with their own money and under their own arrangements and they were submitted for the approval of the Government.\\nThe Government approved some books on each subject as alternative text books, leaving it to the discretion of the Head Masters of different schools to select any alternative book on each subject.\\nIn May 1950 books on certain subjects (like agriculture, history, social studies, etc.) were prepared and published by the Government themselves without inviting offers from private publishers.\\nWith respect to other subjects, offers were invited from \"publishers and authors\".\\nThe alternative method was given up and only one text book on ,each subject was selected.\\nThe Government charged as royalty 5% on the sale price of all the approved text books.\\nIn 1952 a notification was issued by the Government which omitted the word \"Publishers\" altogether and invited only \"authors and others\" to submit books for approval by the Government.\\nThe \"authors and others\" whose books were approved, had to enter into an agreement in the form prescribed by the Government the principal term of the agreement was that the copyright in these books would vest absolutely in Government and the authors and others\" would get a royalty of 5% on the sale price of the text books.\\nIt was contended that the publishing, printing and selling of text books was thus taken by the Government exclusively into its own hands and the private publishers were altogether ousted from the business.\\nThe petitioners, who purport to carry on the business of preparing, printing, publishing and selling text books for recognised schools in the Punjab, pro29 226 ferred the present petition under article 32 of the Constitution praying for writs of mandamus directing the Punjab Government to withdraw the notifications of 1950 and 1952 on the ground that they contravened the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under the Constitution.\\nHeld that the action of the Government, whether it was good or bad, does not amount to an infraction of the fundamental right guaranteed by article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution.\\nIn the present case no fundamental rights of the petitioners were violated by the notifications and the acts of the executive Government of the Punjab done by them in furtherance of their policy of nationalisation of the text books for the school students.\\nA more chance or prospect of having particular customers cannot be said to be a right to property or to any interest or undertaking within the meaning of article 31(2) of the Constitution and no question of payment of compensation can arise because the petitioners have been deprived of the same.\\nArticles 73 and 162 of the Constitution do not contain any definition as to what the executive function is and what activities would legitimately come within its scope.\\nThey are concerned primarily with the distribution of executive power between the Union on the one hand and the component States on the other.\\nThey do not mean that it is only when Parliament or the State Legislature has legislated on certain items appertaining to their respective lists that the Union executive or the State executive, as the case may be,can proceed to function in respect of them.\\nOn the other hand, the language of article 162 Clearly indicates that the powers of the State executive do extend to matters upon which the State Legislature is competent to legislate and are not confined to matters over which legislation has been passed already.\\nThe same principle underlies article 73 of the Constitution.\\nThe Commonwealth and the Central Wool Committee vs The Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Co.
